Welcome! I am a registered dietitian applying r programming to nutritional data. I am also a master student with the [National Free Pre-pregnancy Checkups Project](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/fys/s3589/201307/0ca30a6cbe7146fba86b0bf9211be576.shtml) and an intern with the [Epidemiological investigation of iron deficiency in preschool children in China: a multicenter status study](https://fuwu.most.gov.cn/html/tztg/xzxkzx/20220923/123124384.html).
  
I am studying Public Health at the [Hangzhou Normal University](http://sph.hznu.edu.cn) and my B.Eng. is in Food Quality and Safety from [Central South University of Forestry and Technology](https://spxy.csuft.edu.cn). My academic work has been [published](https://mutyamua.github.io/publications/) or is forthcoming in *Journal of Nutritional Science and Vitaminology(Tokyo)*, *Psychiatry Research*, *Health and Social Care in the Community*, and *Holistic Nursing Practice*, among other outlets. This research explores the the association between pre-pregnancy Hemoglobin levels and preterm delivery using big data. While primarily focused on preterm birth, it also examines a potential joint effect of residence altitude. I have working experience in in diabetes and postpartum nutrition and I am a certified nutrition specialist with [*The Spring Rain Doctors*](https://m.chunyuyisheng.com/m/doctor/6cca646fc3f48f6b4ba2/) .
